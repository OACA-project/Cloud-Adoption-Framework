# Cloud-Adoption-Framework
Considerations to take care of when selecting a cloud service and provider partner

Cloud adoption and migration discussions are being heard in all enterprises around the world.  Many different viewpoints exist on this digital transformation topic – some see it as a technology initiative, to be driven by IT, and some businesses see it as a key to enabling and enhancing their business functions and reach.  Leaders are regularly caught between these viewpoints, often driven by passionate IT specialists and business staff.  It is important for business leaders who are responsible for deciding or driving a move towards cloud technology use, to be in a position to carefully consider their strategy and approach, and to make informed decisions, with at least a rough understanding of the consequences of the different choices!

The ODCA recently conducted a survey of companies who had implemented cloud technologies and asked the question “What do you wish you had known about your cloud solution before purchasing it”. The responses were remarkably insightful. It was clear that many were taken by surprise by the limitations of or resulting from their choice, and the additional work they needed to do to integrate their cloud solution into their existing environment.

The paper consolidates the insights and observations gleaned from that survey, and the concepts from the ODCA Cloud Maturity Model to provide business leaders with a base from which they can sketch out a mind map of some of the aspects, decisions, and consequences in regard to moving business functions and IT applications to the cloud. Specifically, this paper covers:

•	How to identify and select business functions, services and applications that could move to cloud 
•	Provide questions to ask to identify risks, caveats and benefits of different cloud implementation approaches
•	Provide guidance on the additional changes that will be required to your Hybrid IT Operating model to support the cloud approach you choose


This paper is designed to be used in conjunction with the Cloud Maturity Model.  The Cloud maturity model provides multiple domains to identify the changes necessary to transform to a Hybrid IT Operating model to support a Cloud project. This document drives out the higher level decisions and strategy regarding cloud, which a leader must provide to their organization to guide their teams’ thinking, decisions, designing and planning when considering which Cloud approach would be best to implement in light of their business IT functional requirements.
